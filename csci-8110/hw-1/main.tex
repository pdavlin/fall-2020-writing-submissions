\section{Project Setup}
All work for this assignment was developed and executed using the Paperspace Gradient online service.
Gradient allows for rapid setup of TensorFlow environments on GPU-powered machines, which was ideal for this first project given that optimizing a personal computer for running machine learning models proved to be difficult for a first attempt at executing the concepts covered in lecture. The downside, however, is that
